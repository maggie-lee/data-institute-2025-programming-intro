#### Web Scraping with Python
##### Goals for the day and a word on jargon

##### What we will do
<ul>
  <li>Run and edit some code</li>
  <li>Know some things to do at a blinking cursor on a blank page</li>
  <li>Experience errors, which are a normal part of programming</li>
  <li>Search online for stuff when we're baffled</li>
  <li>Be better equipped to understanding uses of programming for work, whether you write the code or work with someone who does</li>
</ul>

#### What we will not do
<ul>
  <li>Become ninjas or magicians</li>
  <li>Wear hoodies in the dark at home eating Cheetos & Mountain Dew</li>
  <li>Write entire programs (almost no one writes an entire program anyway.)</li>
</ul>

#### Jargon

<p>Jargon is part of any specialty skill. Chefs, builders, mechanics, economists, everybody uses some work jargon.</p>
<p>No one person understands all the jargon. Always ask if you don't know, it's OK!</p>
<p>It's a bad sign when folks try to gatekeep with jargon. :rage: </p>
